## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- A Google Cloud project with Gmail and Calendar APIs enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google APIs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/j3k0/mcp-google-workspace.git
   cd mcp-google-workspace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration

### OAuth 2.0 Setup

Google Workspace (G Suite) APIs require OAuth2 authorization. Follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. Create OAuth2 Credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API for your project
   - Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" or "Web application" as the application type
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with required information
   - Add authorized redirect URIs (include `http://localhost:4100/code` for local development)

2. Required OAuth2 Scopes:
   ```json
   [
     "openid",
     "https://mail.google.com/",
     "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic",
     "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar",
     "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
   ]
   ```

3. Create a `.gauth.json` file in the project root with your Google OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "installed": {
       "client_id": "your_client_id",
       "project_id": "your_project_id",
       "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
       "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
       "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
       "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
       "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:4100/code"]
     }
   }
   ```

4. Create a `.accounts.json` file to specify which Google accounts can use the server:
   ```json
   {
     "accounts": [
       {
         "email": "your.email@gmail.com",
         "account_type": "personal",
         "extra_info": "Primary account with Family Calendar"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   You can specify multiple accounts. Make sure they have access in your Google Auth app. The `extra_info` field is especially useful as you can add information here that you want to tell the AI about the account (e.g., whether it has a specific calendar).

### Authenticate

Once `.gauth.json` and `.accounts.json` are configured, authenticate your accounts:

```bash
npm run authenticate
```

This opens a browser for each configured account to complete the OAuth consent flow. The script waits up to 5 minutes per account for the callback.

```bash
# Authenticate a specific account
npm run authenticate -- user@gmail.com

# Force re-authentication (e.g. after OAuth scope changes)
npm run authenticate -- user@gmail.com --force

# Custom config paths (same flags as the server)
npm run authenticate -- --gauth-file /path/to/.gauth.json --accounts-file /path/to/.accounts.json
```

If installed via npm, you can also run:

```bash
npx mcp-gmail-authenticate
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Configure Claude Desktop to use the mcp-google-workspace server:

On MacOS: Edit `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: Edit `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-google-workspace": {
      "command": "<dir_to>/mcp-google-workspace/launch"
    }
  }
}
```

        "mcp-google-workspace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Optional arguments:
   - `--gauth-file`: Path to the OAuth2 credentials file (default: ./.gauth.json)
   - `--accounts-file`: Path to the accounts configuration file (default: ./.accounts.json)
   - `--credentials-dir`: Directory to store OAuth credentials (default: current directory)

2. The server will start and listen for MCP commands via stdin/stdout.

3. On first run for each account, it will:
   - Open a browser window for OAuth2 authentication
   - Listen on port 4100 for the OAuth2 callback
   - Store the credentials for future use in a file named `.oauth2.{email}.json`

## Available Tools

### Account Management

1. `gmail_list_accounts` / `calendar_list_accounts`
   - List all configured Google accounts
   - View account metadata and descriptions
   - No user_id required

### Gmail Tools

1. `gmail_query_emails`
